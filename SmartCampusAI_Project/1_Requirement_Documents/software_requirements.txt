Prototype Building: 
Hereâ€™s how you can structure your tech stack and workflow for this approach:

ðŸ”¹ Frontend

HTML â†’ For structure of pages (login, dashboard, student info, etc.)

CSS â†’ For styling; you can also use Bootstrap for faster responsive design if you want.

Vanilla JS â†’ For interactivity (form validation, DOM updates, AJAX calls).

Tip: Even without React, you can make dynamic pages using AJAX / Fetch API to interact with your backend.

ðŸ”¹ Backend

Node.js â†’ The runtime

Express.js â†’ Lightweight server framework for handling routes and APIs

MySQL â†’ Database

Other Useful Packages:

mysql2 â†’ Node.js connector for MySQL

dotenv â†’ Manage environment variables (DB credentials, API keys)

bcrypt â†’ For password hashing

express-session â†’ For login sessions

ðŸ”¹ Architecture Idea

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) â†’ Sends requests to backend via forms or Fetch API

Backend (Node + Express) â†’ Receives requests, validates, queries MySQL, sends responses

Database (MySQL) â†’ Stores:

Colleges

Students

Faculties

Courses / Subjects

Attendance / Marks

Admin accounts

âœ… Best Balanced Stack for You (if starting now):

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js + Express.js (REST APIs)

Database: MySQL (initially)

Mobile (later): React Native

Payments: Stripe / Razorpay
